Lighting:
    ambient light does not seem to illuminate model
    direction in sun is where it comes from not where it goes



Models:
    Blender:
        set animations to have fake user, and click stash
        export as embedded gltf
    AnimComposer may bug out directly from spatial, cast body to a node then child 0 refers to the spatial


Movement:
    track the orientation as a vector 3 for forward and backward 
    use the .rotate() thing on the spatial not the node
    then grab the spatial's quaternion rotation around the appropriate axis for the orientation (probably z if on ground)
    




Movement:
